  <h1 id="platform-policy">Platform Policy</h1>
<p>By using the Stashy APIs, you agree to this policy.  We reserve the right to change this policy at any time without notice, so please check it regularly. Your continued use of the Stashy APIs constitutes acceptance of any changes. You also agree to and are responsible for ensuring that you comply with the <a href="https://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/">Stashy Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119/">Stashy Community Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>We provide the Stashy APIs to support several types of apps and services. First, we provide them to help members of our community share their own content with apps or services. We also support apps and services that help brands and advertisers understand and manage their audience, develop their content strategy, and obtain digital rights. Finally, we provide the Stashy APIs to help broadcasters and publishers discover content, get digital rights to media, and share media using web embeds. The Stashy APIs are not intended for other types of apps or services. For those we do support, the following terms and information also apply:</p>
<h2 id="a-general-terms">A. General Terms</h2>

<li>Obtain a person's consent before including their User Content in any ad.</li>
<li>Only store or cache User Content for the period necessary to provide your app's service.</li>

<li>Don't transfer any data that you receive from us (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any ad network, data broker, influencer network, or other advertising or monetization-related service.</li>

<h2 id="c-things-you-should-know">C. Things you should know</h2>
<ol>
<li>Stashy primarily communicates with developers through email. Please ensure that the email addresses associated with your Stashy account are current and that you don't filter out these messages.</li>
<li>Stashy may rate limit or block apps that make a large number of calls to the API that are not primarily in response to direct user actions.</li>
<li>Enforcement is both automated and manual, and can include disabling your app, restricting you and your app's access to Stashy APIs, requiring that you delete data, terminating our agreements with you or any other action that we deem appropriate.</li>
<li>Stashy may change, suspend, or discontinue the availability of any Stashy APIs at any time.  In addition, Stashy may impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Stashy APIs or the Stashy website without notice or liability.</li>
<li>If Stashy elects to provide you with support or modifications for the Stashy APIs, this support may be terminated at any time without notice to you.</li>
<li>Stashy reserves the right to charge fees for future use of or access to the Stashy APIs.</li>
<li>Stashy doesn't guarantee that any Stashy APIs are free of inaccuracies, errors, bugs, or interruptions, or are reliable, accurate, complete, or otherwise valid.</li>
<li>Licensed Uses and Restrictions: The Stashy APIs are owned by Stashy and are licensed to you on a worldwide (except as limited below), non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable basis in accordance with these terms. Your license to the Stashy APIs continues until it is terminated by either party.  Please note that User Content is owned by users and not by Stashy. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Stashy.</li>
<li>Disclaimer of Any Warranty: Stashy APIs and all data derived through such APIs are provided "as is" with no warranty, express or implied, of any kind and Stashy expressly disclaims any and all warranties and conditions, including but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, availability, security, title and non-infringement. You are solely responsible for any damage that results from the use of any Stashy APIs and all any data derived through such APIs including, but not limited to, any damage to your computer system or loss of data.</li>
<li>Limitation of Liability: Stashy shall not, under any circumstances, be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with use of the Stashy APIs and any data derived through such APIs, whether based on breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort (including negligence, product liability or otherwise), or any other pecuniary loss, whether or not Stashy has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Under no circumstances shall Stashy be liable to you for any amount.</li>
<li>Release and Waiver: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release and waive all claims against Stashy, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners, and employees from any and all liability for claims, damages (actual and/or consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation costs and attorneys' fees) of every kind and nature, arising from or in any way related to your use of the Stashy APIs and data derived through such APIs. If you are a California resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code 1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." You understand that any fact relating to any matter covered by this release may be found to be other than now believed to be true and you accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in fact. In addition, you expressly waive and relinquish any and all rights and benefits which you may have under any other state or federal statute or common law principle of similar effect, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
<li>Hold Harmless and Indemnify: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to hold harmless and indemnify Stashy and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners, and employees from and against any third-party claim arising from or in any way related to your use of the Stashy APIs and any data derived through the APIs, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and/or consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature. Stashy shall use good faith efforts to provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action.</li>
<li>Relationship of the Parties: Notwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of the Stashy API Terms, you and Stashy shall be and act independently and not as partner, joint venturer, agent, employee or employer of the other. You don't have any authority to assume or create any obligation for or on behalf of Stashy, express or implied, and you must not attempt to bind Stashy to any contract.</li>
<li>Invalidity of Specific Terms: If any provision of the Stashy API Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and that the other provisions remain in full force and effect.</li>
<li>No Waiver of Rights by Stashy: Stashy's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Stashy API Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li>
